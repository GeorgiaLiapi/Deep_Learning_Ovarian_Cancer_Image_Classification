**This whole project was an attempt for a *supplementary computational approach* in Python, for my Master Thesis Topic.**

* Mainly, the *'DeepHistology'* pipeline was used, in Matlab (from Dr. Med. JNK, https://github.com/jnkather/DeepHistology).

The Python-based approach was based on the idea of treating the images as 'full paths', organized in tables, all the way through the scripts
until providing them to the CNNs. This was achieved by utilizing the Keras ‘flow_from_dataframe’ method of the ‘ImageDataGenerator’ class.

*Ten scripts, in this repository's 'SCRIPTS' folder, were created by me, with an experience of one year in the Python language and
interaction with Tensorflow and Keras. It is clear that there is plenty of space for improvements and more ideas. Also, I accept that there 
might be areas that do not fully comply with what is believed to be 'a high quality code' (which is always very useful). 
I am still improving my skills.*

Any constructive critiques about improving these scripts or/and areas that need corrections would be highly appreciated.

**Very Important Note**: Scripts from 8 to 11, as explained in the README.md are not a product of my work.
